# Jennifer (Jen) Fisher


- I am a highly motivated, knowledgeable, and skilled Ph.D. candidate at the University of Alabama at Birmingham in the Graduate Biomedical Scienceâ€™s Genetics, Genomics, & Bioinformatics program (Expected to Graduate Aug. 2023).
- My long-term research interest is to improve genome-driven precision medicine via computational biology and data science methods.
- During my Ph.D. dissertation project, I focused on drug repurposing in low-survival cancers and investigating sex-bias adverse events.
- I have a first-author preprint on drug repurposing in low-survival cancers, sex-aware drug repurposing review, and other publications related to drug repurposing, chromosomal instability, and RNA-Seq analysis.
- In addition, I am currently finishing a project focused on sex-bias adverse events, drug side-effects that are more likely to occur in one sex, by investigating sex-bias gene expression and sex-specific gene-regulatory networks across several tissues.
- Overall, my undergraduate and Ph.D. training in engineering, genomics, and data science and my research interests have prepared me to conduct and lead computational biomedical research studies to improve genome-driven precision medicine.
