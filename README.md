# Jennifer (Jen) Fisher

**Computational Biologist with expertise in AI/ML and bioinformatics for machine learning risk assessment & precision medicine models.**

  At CFD Research, I lead predictive modeling projects for gut microbiome and contributed to QSAR tool development for chemical risk assessment (AFRL). Furthermore, I've supported and won multi-million-dollar proposals for agencies like DTRA, NIH, FDA, and ARPA-Hâ€”including a **$5M DTRA award and a $3M MCDC proposal selected for the basket**. 
  
  I earned my Ph.D. in Genetics, Genomics & Bioinformatics from UAB in 2023, where my research centered on leveraging machine learning for drug repurposing and predicting adverse drug events. My work has led to several publications in areas such as cancer omics, QSAR modeling, and drug response. With a B.S. in Biological Engineering (Biomedical concentration) and a Math minor from Mississippi State University, I bring a strong interdisciplinary foundation that bridges computational modeling, biological systems, and real-world health applications. Overall, I'm passionate about applying data-driven methods to complex biomedical challenges, from therapeutic discovery to biosecurity.
